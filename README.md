# Smarter Coffee API / Protocol

Based on the many efforts of reverse engineering the Smarter Coffee Protocol
([http://smarter.am/coffee/](http://smarter.am/coffee/)), i decided to
collect all information available by going through all existing implementations.

Ultimate goal is, to write some well tested client libraries in different
languages.

Take a look at [doc/api.md](api.md) for a description of the protocol.
